osucabs
=======
Introduction
------------
This project is the code base that powers the website osucabs.  This website was born in 2009 as a means to provide quick mobile access for the Campus Area Bus Service on the Ohio State University campus. Since I have since graduated from OSU (and left Ohio), I have little desire or incentive to improve upon the site.  Since the site still has several hundred users per month (Google Analytics), I want to give the code back to the students that use it to improve upon it and make it better!

Word of warning: This was one of my first big python projects so I'm sure the code is a bit sloppy at times, documented poorly, and has 0% test coverage.  I encourage anyone that wants to help out to do so by submitting code cleanup as well as documentation. :)

This installation guide is setup up assuming you have a brand new server compatible with Redhat Enterprise Linux  (e.g. CentOS, Scientific Linux, Amazon AMI).  I have tested deploying to a clean Amazon EC2 Amazon AMI Linux instance several times.  Feel free to get a hold of me if you have any issues!

Requirements
------------
### Required Packages (rpm distro)
httpd
mod_wsgi
python-setuptools
python-devel		# Required for lxml (can be removed after lxml install)
gcc			# Required for lxml (can be removed after lxml install) 
libxslt-devel		# Required for lxml (can be removed after lxml install)
mongo18-10gen-server	# MongoDB Server

### Required Python modules
web.py
lxml
pymongo 

Installation
------------
### Add the 10gen Mondo DB repo 
#### Copied from http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-redhat-centos-or-fedora-linux/
    cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo
    [10gen]
    name=10gen Repository
    baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1
    EOF
    
### You need to have git to clone our repo, and apache to execute
    sudo yum install -y git httpd mod_wsgi python-setuptools python-devel gcc libxslt-devel mongo18-10gen-server
    sudo easy_install web.py lxml pymongo 
NOTE: I don't like the fact that we have to install gcc...but it is needed for lxml. 

### Here is where I put the directory.  This should be changed to /var/www/
    umask 022
    sudo mkdir /webdata
    cd /webdata/
    
### Pull down the latest git repo
    sudo git clone https://github.com/patrickshuff/osucabs.git
    
### Copy our apache configuration into place
    sudo cp /webdata/osucabs/osucabs_apache.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/osucabs.conf

# Configuration (Apply for your API key and update settings.py!)

### You must apply for a developer API key before using this app
#### Apply for it here: http://trip.osu.edu/bustime/login.jsp
    sudo cp  /webdata/osucabs/sample_settings.py  /webdata/osucabs/settings.py
    sudo vim /webdata/osucabs/settings.py
# Run it!

### Make sure MongoDB is enabled on reboot
    sudo chkconfig mongod on
    
### Start MongoDB
    sudo service mongod start
    
### Make sure apache starts on boot
    sudo chkconfig httpd on
    
### Start the apache process
    sudo service httpd start



Troubleshooting
---------------
The first place you should probably start (assuming you have apache installed, and the config in place) is looking at the apache error_log:

    sudo less /var/log/httpd/error_log

### The bus times on the webpage are way way off?  what's up?
Well the problem is likely your server is in a different timezone.  Make sure your server is set up to use eastern time zone

    sudo cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern /etc/localtime
